         Urban FT is a financial tech company that specializes in custom built, white-label apps for its clients, which includes
        Sprint, Boost Mobile Wallet, and 70 + credit unions across the US.
        <br>
        <br> For this particular piece, I wanted to showcase the process and end results for a friend pay fuctionality (p2p in industry
        terms) that we were tasked to implement for its core white-label banking app. In order to maintain confidentiality, I’ve
        changed the branding and designs of the application.

      <div class="paragraph">Friend pay in its current form, as presented by an api partner of Urban FT, was recorded to have a very low use percentage
      among the users of the banking application. Most reasons pointed to bogged down features, long flows, and inability for immediate
      access of the funds. Another big reason was because users were confused by all the different styles of “transfers” that were
      readily available in the app.</div>
      <div class="spacer-3"></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Our proposed solutions became several “how might we’s.” Namely, how might we streamline this process, and how might we establish
      the “first time” value of this feature so people can return to using it?</div>

        <div class="paragraph">First, we tore through 400 plus pages of API documentations provided by the partner to find and record the functionalities

        user flows. Once we were finished with creating the flows, we went through several processes of “Crazy 8s” to sketch the
        key screens requireed for this process. (Crazy 8’s is a time-effective design technique, where you try to sketch out 8 widely
        different concepts in the span of 8 minutes.)</div>

      <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 inside-element">
        <div class="paragraph">We started with paper prototypes, then used the valuable feedback we gained to iterate on an Invision prototype. For example,
        as we theorized, none of the users were keen on setting up a security password system. P2p was something they wanted to do
        immediately, in and out, and having extra steps for it was an immediate roadblock. In terms of the security scarce of sending
        it to the wrong phone number, we weighed the need for a smooth flow to be more important than the slim use-case of sending
        it to a wrong phone number. Furthermore, there is the option of cancelling the money transaction before it hits the recipient.</div>
        <div class="spacer-3"></div>
        <div class="paragraph"> The same was the case for setting up date and frequency within the flow. We correctly assumed that p2p was most often times
        a singular affair. Some users expressed favorably for the option to set a date, but was not keen on having to do it within
        the flow. Furthermore, we were able to obtain data of the usage of the date and frequency feature from our api partner, and
        it numbered extremely low. Thus, we adjusted the flows by having the date pre-filled in the review screen, and getting rid
        of the frequency option entirely.</div>
