        As part of a Q3 2019 project, business wanted to re-design the Stored Value (SV) experience offered from Bed Bath, externally called “My Funds.” As the head designer of the My Account Workstream, my task was to take the complicated logic behind the scenes and condense it into a user-friendly experience.

    <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 inside-element">
      <div class="paragraph">
        The Bed Bath Stored Value (SV) program called My Funds work in a complicated logic for general customers to understand.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="bold-text">Pernament Funds</span> - Value that do not expire. Examples include refunds from returns and value transferred from physical gift cards.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="bold-text">Expiring Funds</span> - Value that will last for a limited amount of time. They can be earned during various promotions that are run online and in store. Furthermore, each Expiring Fund earned can have different expiration dates, and for a customer to use them together, their cart must be equal or higher to the funds combined.
        <br>
        <br>
        For ex, say customer have 3 Expiring Funds; $10 expiring in Feb 1, $10 expiring in Feb 2nd, and $10 expiring in Feb 3rd. If the customer wishes to use all $30 combined, their cart must be equal or higher to $30. Or, if he/she wishes to use parts of the Funds before they expire (for ex. the $10 that expires in Feb 1) the cart must be equal or higher to $10.
        <br>
        <br>
        The issue thus became, how to condense this complicated logic in a user-friendly way.

      <div class="paragraph">
        There were key scenarios that we had to account for, with variations of some key factors. Examples included,
        <br>
        <br>
        - User applied Expiring Funds
        <br>
        - User applied Permanent Funds

        - User applied both
        <br>
        - User earned Funds under a Promotion for next purchase
        <br>
        - Business wants to advertise Promotion to give user incentive to spend more

          - Users understood that Funds were being applied, but that’s all they knew.
          <br>
          - Users did not clearly make the connection between the “Campaign message” and the Funds applied.
          <br>
          - 3/5 users felt confused about where the “$34.00 My Funds Applied” came from.

          Feedback from users were mixed. About 2/5 users felt that the module used was not clear enough that it’s clickable. They also took extra time understanding all of the sections involved.
          <br>
          <br>
          There were also feedback from business. The Cart & Checkout team was worried that the module could push the page down too much, which could impact sales.

            After much iteration, we landed close to this design. Here, instead of expanding directly on the cart page, I added a link that would open up the My Funds functionalities as a drawer - mirroring the existing experience of applying coupons under “Apply an Offer Code”.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also added in a quick “How it Works” section for users who are curious about the breakdown of their Expiring Funds, as well as separate drawers for Promotions and FAQ.

            We began to account for all the different scenarios that would come with the factors of Expiring and Permanent Funds, as well as with promotions, and began writing the messaging that would be applied accordingly. This was done as a balancing act between user needs and business promotion. For example, if user had funds and they were automatically applied to the cart, we would highlight that and add in an “upsell” message (you can spend $1 more to apply another $X). If user had funds and Bed Bath was also running a promotion, we would highlight the promotion first as a business need.
